# E-commerce Microservices

### This repository contains a set of microservices that together form a simplified e-commerce platform. It is not a monolithâ€”each service is independent, following microservice architecture principles. The purpose of this repository is purely educational, providing a playground to explore concepts such as:

- Service decomposition
- Inter-service communication
- Event-driven architecture
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Integration with databases, queues, and external APIs

### Each microservice can run independently, and the repository demonstrates patterns and practices useful for learning and experimenting with scalable, maintainable systems.

### Included is a diagram showing the architecture of the services and their interactions.
